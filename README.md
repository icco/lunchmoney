Golang API wrapper for Lunch Money API

To use this API, you need to create an API token by following the directions at [developers.lunchmoney.app](https://developers.lunchmoney.app/).

## Notes

 - We currently only support read only requests. We'd love a PR to add support for write though!
 - We currently only support Go 1.23 and greater.
